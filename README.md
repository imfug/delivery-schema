# IMF Delivery Schema
#### Version 1.0
#### Release Candidate #1

Based on the collective experience of the IMF users including content producers, service providers, media distributors, and system manufacturers, a working group was established to assess the feasibility and examine the limitations of automating the delivery specification and IMF validation process. The result of this open and collaborative effort is the definition of this IMF Delivery Schema XML document that accurately describes CPL constraints for IMF deliveries. The Delivery Schema serves the following dual purpose:

1. Provide information for someone creating an IMF for delivery to the entity who specifies the delivery.
2. Specify a way to validate a delivered IMP to ensure that it meets the specs the receiving entity has paid out.
